Well Completion Report of GKS101NCA#1 Geology Operations Group, WOB, Mumbai 50 CHAPTER 11: CONCLUSIONS The location GKS101NCA-A, was proposed in 8th EPMB and released in June- 16 after review in MCR-15 on approval of Director Exploration in the NELP block GK- OSN-2010/1 as Exploratory, ‘B’ category with an objective to explore hydrocarbon potential of Tertiary Sequence with a target depth of 2150m MSL or 100m in Basement. The well was spud on 01.02.2017 at 1300hrs and drilled as well GKS101NCA#1. The well has penetrated Kandla, Chhasra, Godhra, Narayan Sarovar, Tuna, Fulra, Jakhau, Nakhtarana Formation and was terminated after drilling 105m in Deccan Trap to well TD of 2115m. Formation tops encountered in the well were shallower with respect to prognosis, however Deccan Trap was 21.3m deeper. Further, the well is deeper with respect to the nearby wells GK-40-1 & GK-39-1 at all levels but it is shallower with respect to Well GK-1-2 at all levels except at Chhasra. During drilling fluorescence and cut was observed in cuttings in the intervals 925m-926m, 946-948m & 995-1000m. Formation gas was also observed at 916m, 921m, 922m and 926m TGmax: 4.21%, C1-C3 components in sands of Chhasra formation. Further, Side wall cores taken at 920m, 924m and 925m also showed hydrocarbon presence. A Conventional Core, CC#1 was cut in the interval 948-957m in Godhra Formation. The core consisted of 5cm argillaceous Limestone NF/NC, 2.48m Shale MF/NC, 0.91m Chalky Limestone GYF/Bluish white cut and 1.59m Compact Limestone at bottom. MDT sample collected at 916m yielded gas. MDT samples were also collected at 919.5m, 920.5m, 921.5m, 922.5m and 925m yielded gas, water and traces of oil. No hydrocarbon shows were observed during drilling in formations below 1000m. Further on the basis of wireline logs, SWC and MDT the zones below 1000m were found to be devoid of hydrocarbons. Hence, an isolation plug of was placed in the

Well Completion Report of GKS101NCA#1 Geology Operations Group, WOB, Mumbai 8 was recorded in the interval 2107m to 758m. In Run#5, VSP log was recorded from 2100m to 73.95m. In Run#6, MSCT tool was lowered and side wall cores were cut in the interval 2093-917.5m Attempted: 35, Recovered: 35, Accepted: 30, Rejected: 5. Schlumberger wireline was rigged down. Isolation Plug In view of no hydrocarbon prospectivity below 1000m and to ensure good cement bond against Chhasra Formation, decision was made to short land 9-⅝” casing after isolation of open hole below 1000m. Mule shoe with 5” drill pipe was lowered to 1175m. Hi-vis mud was spotted at 1175 to 1075m. String was pulled out to 1075m. Circulation was carried out with 11.5ppg mud. Cement unit was lined up and surface lines were pressure tested to 2500psi. Isolation plug job was carried out by pumping 20bbl, 13.5ppg spacer followed by 65bbl, 15.8ppg cement slurry and 3bbl, 13.5ppg post spacer and displaced with 45bbl, 11.5ppg fresh mud. Mule shoe was pulled out to surface and laid down. 12-1/4” slick assembly was lowered to tag cement top at 966m. Cement was drilled to 1000m leaving approx. 75m cement plug in the interval 1000- 1075m. 9 5/8” Casing and Cementation A wiper trip was carried out and after circulating at 1000m depth and 12 ¼” slick assembly was pulled out of hole. 9-5/8” casing P-110, 53.5ppf, 84 joints was lowered and cemented as per plan keeping shoe at 1000m and float collar at 975m. Plug was bumped at 3000psi and dropped to 900psi in 1min. After WOC, casing was rough cut and 13-5/8” BOP stack was nippled down. ‘C’-section well head & 13-5/8” BOP stack were installed and function tested. BOP stack was pressure tested at 300psi/5000psi. 2.1.4 Hermetical Test: 8 ½” slick assembly was lowered and float collar was tagged at 975m with 10kips. Circulation was made and 8 ½” slick assembly was pulled out of hole. 9 5/8” casing scrapper was lowered up to 975m and casing was scrapped thrice in the interval from 800m to 975m. Circulation was made and scrapper assembly was pulled out of hole. Subsequently USIT-CBL-VDL-GR log was recorded in the interval 970-758m at 0psi & 700psi for cement bond evaluation. 8 ½” bit with 9 5/8” scrapper was lowered to

Well Completion Report of GKS101NCA#1 Geology Operations Group, WOB, Mumbai 1 CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION 1.1 Objective The location GKS101NCA#A was released as a B-Category, exploratory location in water depth of 31.70m with an objective to explore the hydrocarbon potential of Tertiary Sequence. 1.2 Geological Setup Kutch offshore basin is an east-west oriented pericratonic rift basin in the north- western part of the western continental margin of India. This basin is bounded by the Nagar-Parkar fault in the north, Radhanpur-Barmer Arch in the east and the North Kathiawar fault in the south. The basin encompasses around 71,000 sq. km. out of which 28,000 sq. km. is offshore upto 200m bathymetry. This category-ll basin has been classified as "Medium-High Risk and Low-Medium Reward basin, under the risk-reward categorization. This basin was formed due to rifting and counter-clockwise rotation of the Indian plate after it got detached from Gondwanaland during Late Triassic or Early Jurassic. The major tectonic events during the formation of the basin can be summarized in following steps.  Initiation of protracted extensional tectonics leading to the eventual cleavage of east and west Gondwana.  A second phase of rifting/drifting separated Seychelles/India from Madagascar creating the Mascarene basin.  A third and final phase of rifting/drifting led to the opening of the southwest Indian Ocean. Envisaged Tertiary Petroleum system in Kutch Offshore offshore is referred as Jakhau–Fulra Petroleum System with shale in Jakhau Formation Paleocene as source rock and Limestone / Sandstone lithofacies of Fulra Formation Eocene and Limestone within Jakhau Paleocene as the reservoir rocks. Thick shales and tight limestone within Tertiary sequence can act as seals for Paleocene, Eocene and Miocene reservoirs The location GKS101NCA-A falls in the central part of the GKOSN2010/1 NELP- IX block and forms a four way closure at Early Eocene level Fig I & II. The location is proposed to explore Tertiary sequences. The well GK-39-1 in this area has established
